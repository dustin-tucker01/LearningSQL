# Learning SQL

In my learning of SQL, I have developed a problem solving learning approach with SQL that has allowed me to better grasp and master difficult concepts. In doing so, I would like to showcase **some** of the problems I have solved along my journey of learning complex SQL.

|[8 Week SQL Challenge](https://github.com/dustin-tucker01/8WeekSQLChallenge/tree/main) |I am currently working on mastering my problem solving and data manipulation ability in SQL through completing the [8 week SQL challenge](https://8weeksqlchallenge.com/). (2 of 8 case studies solved)| 
| [Advanced SQL Puzzles](https://github.com/dustin-tucker01/AdvancedSQLPuzzles)| This repository serves as the solutions for the advanced SQL puzzles from the [Advanced SQL Puzzles](https://github.com/smpetersgithub/AdvancedSQLPuzzles/tree/main/Advanced%20SQL%20Puzzles) repository. It showcases my ability to tackle various SQL problems and demonstrates my proficiency in SQL query writing and problem-solving skills. (30 of 70+ puzzles solved) | 
|[Olympic History Problems](https://github.com/dustin-tucker01/OlympicHistorySQLProblems) | I solved 20 complex SQL problems relating to Olympic data. I gained access to these problems and datasets from [this blog](https://techtfq.com/blog/practice-writing-sql-queries-using-real-dataset) from a well known youtuber [TechTFQ](https://www.youtube.com/@techTFQ).|
